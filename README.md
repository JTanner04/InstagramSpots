# 📸 Instagram Spots  

**Instagram Spots** is a mobile app that helps users discover the most aesthetic, photo-worthy locations nearby — from nature views to city landmarks — based on their selected vibe and distance preferences. Built for travelers, influencers, and explorers who want to capture their best moments effortlessly.

## 🌍 Overview  
Instagram Spots uses geolocation and the Mapbox API to identify scenic or “Instagrammable” places around a user’s current location. Users can choose a travel radius, select whether they prefer to drive or fly, and pick their desired environment type (e.g., city, nature, or aesthetic).  

The app then intelligently recommends destinations that match the user’s preferences, showing real-time map markers and location details to make exploration simple and spontaneous.
